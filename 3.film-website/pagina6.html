But the pirates who serve under us would never follow a man who had stolen the Deep Sea Opal. So despite the fact that I do not fear any sort of curse, I cannot steal it.

I do not entirely believe there is any power in this opal beyond the value it will hold as a precious gem. But the pirates who serve under us would never follow a man who had stolen the Deep Sea Opal. So despite the fact that I do not fear any sort of curse, I cannot steal it."
